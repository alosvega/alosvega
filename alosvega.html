            Welcome to my website! My name is Alondra Sanchez Vega, and I am a mexican-american first generation college student. 
            I attend Las Positas Community College, studying electrical engineering. Soon I hope to transfer to a UC, 
            in electrical as well. I'm considering a double major or minor in physics, but nothing is set yet.

            where are you from? how did you get into engineering? 
          -->
          I'm from Tracy California, I've been living here my whole life practically so it's where I call home. In high school, 
          I was apart of the Engineering Pathway, but actually  decided as physics as my major(before I changed). After taking my first computer science course,
          I was in between changing to electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science. Science was always my 
          favorite subject in school, and starting college allowed me to further explore my interests in these fields.

            current job? future job? internship? what r u up to rn 
        -->
        I have a couple jobs at the moment, I'm a seasonal associate at a retail store, I'm just starting as a driver for uber, 
        and I serve as a recreational aide for the City of Dublin. These and my past jobs have been a great experience for me, 
        as I got to work on my soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and time management. However, I'm looking to apply my skills
        and get to work hands on in an internship. Throughout my courses, I've learned a lot of technical skills and would love to apply it 
        and learn more about my fields of interests as well.
