                Most projects I've completed are ones I've done during courses, this one during my first computer science course,
                Computing Fundamentals 1, where we learn on the basics of C++.

            <li>
                Another completed project is this website! Big shocker.
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            This are my upcoming and future projects. Once I'm done with this website I'll go straight into these.
